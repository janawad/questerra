								<p>If you wish to book (“Booking”) a tour (“Tour”) with a tour operator (“Tour Operator”) using Questerra Tours (“Questerra”) then you (“the customer”) agree that the following terms and conditions shall apply:</p>
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">OUR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; ONLINE BOOKING & FINANCIAL PROTECTION:</h3>
								<p>On receipt of your deposit, subject to availability and at our discretion, Questerra will reserve your place on your selected holiday. A contract is made between you and the Exventures International LLP only upon your booking being confirmed and accepted by us and our communication thereof to you or your travel agent.</p>
								<p>You can purchase our services from our sales outlets, agents or franchises. In the alternative, you can register and book your tour / services online through our website. Our website provides the facility of making online booking of tours and services. However, we cannot give any guarantee or warranty with respect to the website booking engine which could malfunction due to well-known reasons including software or network errors. We have incorporated all modern protection technologies to ensure that information concerning you or your payments is kept secure and confidential. It is made clear that the online booking shall be effective once you confirm the terms and conditions, as follows. During the course of online booking on our website, you will have the opportunity to go through our terms and conditions and privacy policy, which are displayed on our website and which you will need to confirm and accept in the course of booking online. Further, you will also need to send us a hard copy of the said signed Terms and Conditions confirming that you have read, understood and accepted the Terms and Conditions and other applicable documents including Brochure and / or, Itinerary and / or Price Grid and / or promotion booklet etc. We would also require a copy of the first two pages and last two pages of your passport which show the date of your passport, place and date of issue and expiry, amongst other documentation. Please see under the ‘documentation’ section for the list. The Company reserves the right to decline to register any person / s for any tour or to cancel their registration without assigning any reason.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; BROCHURE/WEBSITE INFORMATION – DISCLAIMERS:</h3>
								<p>We take reasonable care in preparing the brochure, price grid, web pages and other documents and in describing the services therein. However, we are not liable for any typographical / printing errors. Furthermore, brochures may be printed several months in advance and the content may not always be fully updated. We therefore ask you to confirm the current information by contacting us. Please note that the itinerary may have changed. The products and services displayed may have changed. The photos of meals / sightseeing / properties are for reference only and may differ from the actual meals / sights. Distance between places and temperatures are approximate and can change depending on travel, road conditions and climatic changes. Hotels may have to be booked far off from the central place.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; ITINERARY MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME:</h3>
								<p>We reserve the right to alter, amend, change or modify the tour package and itineraries before or during the tour. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you promptly of such changes / events sufficiently in advance during booking or prior to departure of the tour. If such changes / events occur during the tour, our tour manager or local representative will inform you of the changes on the spot and we solicit your full co – operation in accepting such circumstantial changes. Therefore, no grievance regarding any itinerary / service change which we are constrained to make, will be entertained from the tour participants during or after the tour. Please note that promotional offers may have different terms and conditions which will be in addition to these terms and conditions and the requirements of the booking deposits, payments, deadlines and mode of payment may be defined in such promotions which will be over and above these terms and conditions. Such changes may be necessitated due to factors beyond our control such as Force Majeure events, strikes, fairs, festivals, sport events, weather conditions, traffic problems, overbooking of hotels / flights, cancellation / re-routing of flights or railway, closure of / restricted entry at a place of sightseeing etc. Generally, we try to avoid dates when big Fairs, Exhibitions, Olympics etc. and other events are held in certain cities as hotels are fully booked several years ahead. If you have to travel on such dates, you may have to stay in alternate hotels or hotels in other cities.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; IF WE CANCEL OR CHANGE YOUR HOLIDAY:</h3>
								<p>&bull; Questerra reserves the right to change or cancel your booking in accordance with operating requirements or circumstances beyond its control.</p>
								<p>&bull; Should change or cancellation prove necessary we will give you reasonable notice thereof, in the circumstances, and where available, offer you a comparable alternative. Where cancellation is necessary, a minimum period of 45 days notice will be given by us unless the circumstances leading to the cancellation were beyond our reasonable control.</p>
								<p>&bull; If an alternative is not available or acceptable you will be entitled to either a full refund of monies paid by you to us or transfer to another Questerra holiday without payment of any transfer fee.</p>
								<p>&bull; If the change or cancellation is due to force majeure (i.e. circumstances like political unrest, war or threat of war, riots, civil strife, closure of airports or ports, industrial disputes, terrorist activity, Acts of God, adverse weather conditions or other similar events beyond Questerra’s control) we will give a full refund of any monies paid to us less reasonable expenses incurred by us in respect of your booking.</p>
								<p>&bull; Questerra is not responsible for the cost of any other travel arrangements affected due to cancellation or the rescheduling of any holiday.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; OUR SCOPE OF SERVICES:</h3>
								<p>We are travel and holiday organizers only. We inspect and select the services to be provided to you. However, we do not own, operate or control any airline, shipping company, coach or coach company, hotel, transport, restaurant, kitchen caravan or any other facility or provider etc. that is engaged to provide you services during the course of your tour. Therefore, please carefully note that: (1) you will need to adhere to the conditions, rules and regulations of each service provider. For instance, you will need to check the baggage rules of the airline to understand what kind of baggage and how much baggage you can carry. You will need to check the hotel rules to check what the mealtimes are, at which you should make yourself available. The company is not responsible / liable for the consequences if you breach such rules and regulations; (2) If you cause any injury or damage affecting the service provider, then you may be liable to the service provider and if the service provider recovers any monies from us for such injury or damages, we shall separately charge you for the same; (3) we cannot be held responsible / liable for any delay, deficiency, injury, death, loss or damage etc. occasioned due to act or default of such service providers, their employees or agents.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; MEALS:</h3>
								<p>Please refer to the itinerary in the brochure / website for details of the meals which would be served to you on the tour. Unlike an airline, we cannot process a special meal, nor can we guarantee a special diet. The same is at the sole discretion of the service provider. We do not assure special meals or special timings or extra halts for infants, children, or passengers with diabetes, cholesterol, high blood pressure or any other condition. We cannot guarantee quantity of the food as may be provided by the service provider.

We, however, reserve the right to change the meal arrangement, where circumstances compel us to do so. At some places a meal allowance may be paid to you at our discretion to enable you to have a meal of your own choice.</p><br>

When we receive Indian rupees from you in relation to a booking, we convert them into the foreign exchange component of the tour cost at our selling rate, then applicable and credit the proceeds in our bank account. However, when we refund the foreign exchange component to you in Indian rupees, we do so at our buying rate applicable on the date of refund, because the bank will convert the money at the buying rate and credit the same in Indian Rupees.</p>

								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;"> GENERAL GUIDELINES</h3>
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; VISA GUIDANCE SRVICES:</h3>
								<p>It is necessary for you to ensure that you have the appropriate passport, which is valid for at least six months after you return to India. Furthermore, you will be required to take the appropriate visas for going on the tour. We provide you visa guidance services for which we will charge you. Such charges may include not only the actual visa charge and costs incurred but also our service charge. Even if you do not get your visa, you will be liable to pay the applicable charges. If you already possess a visa or wish to do the visa / s on your own, you would be entitled only for the refund of actual visa / s cost and the portion of charges attributable to our service charges will still have to be paid by you. It is your responsibility to promptly furnish to us all documents required for application of your visas etc. latest by 60 days before the departure date. In fact, in the current scenario it would be far more prudent to furnish all documents at least four months before the departure date. Given the security concerns and the over-cautious approach adopted by embassies and consulates, visa processing can take quite long. Please note that we may receive documents submitted late but we are not responsible for rejection or non-receipt of visas due to inadequate or late submissions. You are required to furnish only genuine documentation. Granting / rejection of visas is the sole discretion of embassy / consulate. We only act as a facilitator for obtaining visas. You may be required to appear personally before embassy / consulate for any interview(s) / providing biometrics. The Company shall under no circumstance be held liable or responsible for rejection of visas and any other incidental or consequential loss, damage, cost or expense. You undertake not to proceed legally against the company for such rejection of visas, unless there is a manifest error committed by the company. We would not be responsible / liable in any manner whatsoever for any clerical error done by the concerned embassy / consulate regarding the name, attachment of wrong photograph, duration and type of visa (single / multiple entry) or passport number. We always use services of reputed courier companies for the purpose of transmission of passports to the embassies / consulates and to our clients in various cities. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage whether direct, indirect, incidental or consequential caused due to transmission delays or loss of passport or documents in the course of transmission of documents by us to the embassy or to you or in the course of transmission of documents by the embassy / consulate to us. We would however, make best attempts to trace your documents or assist you in obtaining alternative / certified copies of the lost documents. If you are unable to travel on the tour originally booked by you because either you could not get your visa in time or due to an error of the part of the embassy / consulate, an incorrect visa is issued to you, you shall have the option to postpone your tour to any other future date or transfer your tour to any other tour and in such case the amendment fee for shall apply, in addition to cancellation charges. Please note that if the rejection of visa is intimated by the embassy / consulate within the cancellation period specified in the section titled CANCELLATION OF BOOKING BY YOU then the cancellation charges as appearing in that section shall apply. Please further note that for the purpose of ascertaining the applicable cancellation rates, the cancellation would be deemed to have been made on the date we receive intimation of visa rejection from the consulate / embassy. Should you choose to re-apply after visa rejection, then you shall do so at your own risk and cost. If the visa is rejected a second time, the applicable cancellation rates shall be based on the date of receipt of intimation of the rejection of second visa application and so the charges shall be much higher than the rates which would have applied on the first rejection. Should we not receive any intimation from the consulate / embassy either accepting or rejecting a visa application before the departure date of your tour, the maximum cancellation charges shall apply. It is made clear that the cancellation charges shall apply in addition to the retention of visa service charges. You expressly agree not to dispute the foregoing.</p>
								
								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; HEALTH:</h3>
								<p>Please note that your health is entirely your risk and responsibility. Our tours are suitable for persons of reasonable fitness. They may not suit persons who are medically infirm or who have special needs or requirements whether due to age, medical conditions or otherwise. It shall be your duty to inform us in writing in case you have any medical condition that may affect your ability to fully enjoy our tour arrangements or where the interests of other tour participants may be adversely affected by such condition. Under such conditions we may decline to accept you or continue you in this tour. We reserve the right (without obligation) to ask you to undergo medical tests and to provide written certification of your medical fitness before departure or at any time during the tour and if you fail to undergo such tests or fail to provide such certificates, we may decline to accept you or to continue you on the tour. Our actions in this regard may be guided not only by concerns for your health but also the convenience and health of the other tour participants. However, it is not our obligation to check your medical condition and if you suffer any injury or aggravation on the tour or if you are unable to enjoy / complete the whole or any part of the tour due to your medical conditions, we shall not be liable to compensate you nor to refund any amount to you nor to pay your medical expenses. In this regard, please note that service providers such as Airlines may decline to accept you on medical grounds.

								<p>We try to maintain the privacy of the personal information provided by you. However, it would be necessary for us to share this information with Consulates, Embassies, Airlines, Hotels and other service providers who would be providing you service during the tour. We would also be constrained to disclose such information if we receive an order of the court, a requisition from any government or statutory authority, subpoena, or where under any laws, rules or regulations, such disclosure becomes necessary. You agree to let us photograph and / or video graph the tour and specifically you agree to let us photograph and / or video graph you in the course of the tour. You agree to let us publish such photographs / video graphs through all media including print media, websites, letters, emails etc. You also agree to let us track usage statistics. You agree and accept that all such photographs and / or video graphs and statistics are our absolute property and we have the unrestricted right to use them for any legitimate purposes including advertisement and commercial purposes.

								<h3 style="font-size:18px;">&bull; LAW AND JURISDICTION:</h3>

The Mediator shall be appointed by the Company. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within [thirty] days of the appointment of the mediator, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, then the dispute may be settled in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by a sole Arbitrator to be appointed by the Company. The Arbitration proceedings will be in Bangalore. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on both parties. In case of any dispute concerning the award the courts in Bangalore alone shall have exclusive jurisdiction. This contract will be governed by Indian law. You agree that in the event of a dispute or difference between the parties the exclusive jurisdiction shall vest in the competent court / forum / tribunal in Bangalore only. As to the interpretation of the aforesaid terms and conditions, the decision of Questerra shall be final and binding upon you.
