									<p>“Tell me what you eat, and I’ll tell you who you are” - Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin</p>
									<p>We are big on food! It has been an Endeavour to fill our tours with delectable local cuisine. India, a nation with varying cultures, languages, climates and people, boasts a span of history of thousands of years. Also, with a population of over a billion, 300 hundred languages along with 700 dialects, the various historical influences have significantly affected the cultural aspects of Indian culinary arts.</p>
									<p>From ‘Idiappam’ and ‘Puttu’; Idly, Dosai and a 100 varieties of rice from South India or the Maharashtrian ‘Bhaakhar vadi’, ‘Ussal Vadaa’ and ‘Pitla’ or the Bengali ‘Macher Jol’ or ‘Bangla Kichudi’;  Gujarati ‘Ponk’ or ‘Jowar Kichu’; Kashmiri ‘Kahwa’ or the Garhwali ‘Fanna’?  Kumouni ‘Mandua ki Roti’, the Konkani ‘Garadudde Paayas’, the Odiya ‘Jahni Posta’ or the Himachali ‘Channa Madra’;  India being a diverse country, even Indians might not know some of these recipes. Questerra makes sure to have maximum local fare in the meals promised on tour.</p>
									<p><u>Free Crash course on how to eat with your hands!</u></p>
									
									<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">(15) Zen Time</h3>
									<p>Journeys and travel we feel are incomplete without private time. Our hand crafted tours understand that and offer ample “ZEN” time for your relaxation, rejuvenation and retrospection; what’s more, they are usually in places which tend to Question your thought process.</p>
									<h3>Some examples of your ‘ZEN’ time include:</h3>
									<p>CAMPING the Hills</p>
									<p>Night TREKS</p>
									<p>Vineyard and Plantation WALKS</p>
									<p>Nature CAMPING</p>
									<p>Beach GAZING</p>
