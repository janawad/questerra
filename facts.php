								<p>With the commencement of your Indian sojourn I would like to begin by greeting you Namaste. Namaste is a Sanskrit term and it literally means “I bow to you.”  . You might be wondering why to visit that far flung mystical country? Let me offer you an insight about India then you take the call. Let us begin this journey by first gauging the geographical parameters of this country. Where is India? To the South of Asia, lies India a peninsular country in the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean. It bears the semblance of a pearl shining in an oyster. This diamond shaped country entices people all over the world with its diverse landforms. These landforms comprise of the Mountains that border the North of India, the peninsular plateau to the South of India, the coastal plains to the East and West, the island groups of India dotted in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal and the fertile Indo- Gangetic plains in the North of India. The diamond shaped country spirals out into 29 states and 7 union territories. Like the cuts characterize the shape and structure of a diamond. Each state of this continent with its unique identity is monumental in adding to the sparkling shine which makes India stand out. The states have distinguishable features ranging from their language, religious beliefs, dance forms, weather conditions all this and a lot more. </p>
								<p>What is religion? It is like an anchor for life to keep one afloat when the turbulent times roll. It offers the speck of light which dispels the darkness and reaffirms hope. The sacred land of India is the birth place of five religions. Hinduism the oldest religion in the world had its beginning in India. There are as many as 330 million Gods one may worship to seek the answers of life. This religion prescribes anot only teachings but also a lifestyle. The art of Yoga practiced by one and all today is a contribution of Hinduism. Siddhartha Gautama presented to India the gift of Buddhism. Lord Buddha used to impart to his followers the pathway to the attainment of eternal truth is detaching oneself from worldly ties and desires. Mahavira Jain left behind teachings to his followers in the form of Jainism. The primal focus of Jainism was adherence to non violence against all living beings. Islam is a religion governed by the principle of monotheism. The cornerstone of this religion was laid by the revelations of Prophet Mohommed. These revelations are recorded in the Quran the Holy book of the Muslims. Sikhism is the newest addition to India’s religions. The religion was founded by Guru Nanak Dev Ji who was succeeded by nine Sikh Guru. The 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobindh Singh Ji was the last Sikhi Guru. The true Sikhi had to abide by the code of conduct prescribed in the Guru Granth Sahib Ji (Holy book of the Sikhs). Sikhism deters from the practice of idol worship and abolished superstitious beliefs. The doorways of Gurudwaras are open to one and all irrespective of the caste and religion. </p>
								<p>Each religion brings with it a number of festivals prevalent to the belief system followed. The trials and struggles of life often wear you down and one forgets to appreciate the good things in life. An approaching festival enables one to get in touch with their spiritual side and celebrate life for the little things it has to offer. Every festival in India is celebrated with utmost grandeur infusing the air with cheer reinstating ones belief in the Almighty. India is the land of festivals mirroring the vibrant nature of this Nation. Every month Indians have a reason to celebrate. With the coming of the New Year the end of the winter season is marked by celebrating the festival of Lohri. The festivities are marked by people popping puffed rice while encircling the lit up bonfire and singing traditional songs. In the month of February Mahashivratri is celebrated in the honor of Lord Shiva.  It is on this day that Lord Siva performed the dance of destruction. The month of March is marked by a splash of color as we bring in the festival of colors called Holi. The festival of Holi falls on a full moon day, after performing the Holi Pooja the youngsters revel in the festivities by splashing some color. In the month of April Punjabis thank God for their agricultural produce by celebrating the harvest festival of Baisakhi. Hindus are governed by the belief that an auspicious ceremony should be conducted at an auspicious time. In the month of May there comes a day when the Sun and Moon are at its peak and glow the brightest. This day is called Akshaya Tritaya. If June is the ninth month in accordance with the Islamic Calendar then Muslims observe abstinence from food and any form of entertainment and perform their prayers daily. This practice is followed for a month and it is observed as the month of Ramadan. The horizon of the sky lightens up with shine of the full moon indicating that the lunar cycle and the month of fasting has come to an end. On this holy occasion Muslims thank God for being blessed with the strength to maintain abstinence, prepare mouth watering delicacies and make donations to the needy. As we make headway into August the month which brings in the onset of monsoons which is marked by celebrating the Festival of Teej. This festival is significant to the married Hindu Lady who observes fast all day long for the long life of her husband. She breaks her fast when the moon manages to come out of the clouds that threaten to overshadow it. September enlivens the South Indian state of Kerala which brings festivities of ten days to celebrate Onam. It is the harvest festival in the South Indian state of Kerala where in the whole state comes in unison and engages in activities like boat races and decorating the porch of households with colorful pattern s called as Rangoli. The month of October is filled with festivals .One iconic festival in the month of October is the festival of Dussehra. Dussehra marks the triumph of good over evil and the wrong doers are taken to task. Lord Rama who is revered with a lot of devotion rescued his wife Goddess Sita and destroyed the demon Raavana who had held her as hostage. Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after being in exile for twelve year. His presence lit up the city of Ayodhya leading to the celebration of Deepavali also called as the festival of Lights. The festivities of November comprise celebrating Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s Birthday who is the founder of Sikhism. With the arrival of December the year is coming to an end but not the festivities of India.  Christians wait all year round with baited breath to put up that massive Christmas tree, hum that Christmas carol and shop for Christmas Presents. This is to celebrate the birth of Lord Jesus Christ. Well now that’s a packed calendar don’t you think so? </p>
								<p>Have you ever peered through the eyepiece of a Kaleidoscope? Rotating the kaleidoscope will leave you astounded with the vibrant display of colors and array of patterns. If one scrutinized the bird’s eye view of India the variance of its panoramic stills bear semblance to the patterns splayed in the Kaleidoscope. This wondrous country is waiting to greet you.  Indians are guided by the philosophy of Athithi Devo Bhava! What is Athithi Devo Bhava? This is a phrase coined from the ancient Language of Sanskrit. The term implies that a guest should be treated like God under any given circumstance and at any given time. Hospitality is redefined as Indian culture is governed by the Philosophy that God resides in the heart of a guest. We wait in anticipation to welcome you. How do we do it? To thank God for giving us a chance to serve you we light the earthen lamp and perform Aarti (a part of idol worship we light the lamp in front of the deity). To banish the evil that might cross your path we apply a red vermillion paste on your forehead. You will experience royalty as we greet you with a garland of flowers to offer respect to you. Are you  ready to experience hospitality at its best? </p>
