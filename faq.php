								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  WHERE WILL I STAY?</h3>
								<p>Our hotel accommodation is always twin-share (except in some Unique Special Stays and on overnight trains), staying in superior tourist class hotels, many of which are centrally located with great facilities. Twin-share is 2 people, either travelling together or as a same-sex room match. We also offer upgrades to single rooms for a supplement, but please note that on rare occasions the availability at some hotels can be limited.  Questerra’s group size in India is a maximum of 40, a group size small enough to have an intimate Indian experience but big enough to have ultimate fun.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  TRIPS WITHIN TRIPS</h3>
								<p>You may notice on some of our trips that we offer shorter trips within a larger itinerary allowing greater choice & flexibility for our travelers as to when they start and for how long they travel. This means some fellow travelers will join and leave during different stages of those trips. Life’s an adventure and one that’s best spent sharing new experiences with new friends. So, if you have the time don’t take a mini break, instead, choose to see as much of India as possible with us.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  WILL I GET MORE INFORMATION?</h3>
								<p>Upon receipt of final payment, your trip documentation will be released 21 days prior to your departure. Make sure you visit Questerra.com for our Travelers Guide. It’s packed full of essential info for your holiday. You’ll also receive a comprehensive day-by-day itinerary including full details & costs of all ZEN Time optional activities available on your trip. Your free Questerra document wallet & luggage tag will be sent to you with your travel documents. The wallet is a safe place for your tickets & passport.  Questerra reserves the right to substitute an alternative travel accessory for the Questerra document wallet.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  BROCHURE AUTHENTICITY</h3>
								<p>We have put a great deal of effort into producing this brochure. The information given & literature produced by Questerra has been compiled with care & is published in good faith. Sometimes, because of circumstances outside our control, we have to alter some activities due to seasonal closing or repairs to buildings, etc, especially early or late in the season. If this happens, alternative activities will be arranged (where a suitable alternative exists).</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED? </h3>
								<p> You will need to ensure you allow enough money to cover optional lunches & dinners, souvenirs, shopping, drinks, optional activities, entrance fees to some attractions & evening entertainment. When travelling with Questerra in India, you’ll find that you’ll often be using local currencies, particularly in remote areas. The local currencies encountered on trip are the Rupee (India). The country we visit rely largely on cash as opposed to credit cards. In the larger cities you’ll find that established stores will accept credit cards readily, while local market stalls will operate on a cash only basis – accepting only local currency. Local currency is readily available through cash machines in each city. Obtaining a small amount of local currency before you travel is also a good idea. However, you can’t depend solely on a credit/debit card for cash as they are not accepted in all areas.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  ZEN TIME OPTIONAL ACTIVITIES, WHEN DO I CHOOSE? </h3>
								<p> Most optional are arranged & paid for during your trip. Check when booking whether there are optional that must be paid for in advance for your trip. By leaving the final decisions until then, you can choose at the same time as your new friends. You’ll get great value as we get you great rates. Some activities are seasonal & weather dependent. Our optional activities offered on Questerra India trips are operated by 3rd party operators. While every attempt is made to ensure the safety of all activities, the nature of the region means that public liability protection that is offered in many countries may not be applicable in many cases. A waiver will need to be signed by all trip participants to ensure that these conditions are understood & accepted. Note: Travel insurance is compulsory for all Questerra India trips.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  PAST TRAVELLER 5% DISCOUNT  </h3>
								<p> We’re head over heels for our Questerra travelers, particularly those that love us so much they come back for more. That’s why when you travel with us; we’ll offer you a 5% discount on the land portion of your trips from then on.</p>
								<p>• You must have returned and finished your first Questerra trip before you can cash in on your 5% discount on your next adventure.</p>
								<p>• Past traveler discounts can be applied to trips of 7 days or longer only </p>
								<p>• If you’re buying more than one trip back to back, the 5% discount will apply to the most expensive trip </p>
								<p>• We’re going to need a deposit before the discount can be applied to the booking </p>
								<p>• You can’t use it on pre & post-trip accommodation rates & other selected products (because we offer great prices for our travelers on these already)</p>
								<p>• Once you’re a past passenger, you’re eligible for a 5% discount every 6 months so you can keep going with Questerra.</p>
								<p>• The discount applies to brochure prices only & cannot be combined with any non-brochure special market promotions Sound good to you crazy Questerra lovers?</p>
								<p><strong>DO I NEED VACCINATIONS</strong> At the time this brochure went to press (October, 2016), the following immunizations are recommended for travelers in Southeast India by the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention):</p>
								<p>• Diphtheria & tetanus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Typhoid &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Hepatitis A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Rabies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Hepatitis B </p>
								<p>• Malaria & Dengue Fever may also be present within this region. You should consult a travel doctor who specializes in travel medicines or your local doctor to advise on what vaccinations and/or preventative medicines would be required. Don’t forget to bring with you any medication that you may require en route such as antihistamines, antibiotics, etc.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  DO I NEED VISAS?</h3>
								<p>Please read carefully. You are fully responsible for obtaining all necessary visas prior to the departure of your trip. Questerra is not legally permitted to knowingly allow anybody who does not have a valid visa to join a trip. Visa & other entry & exit conditions (such as currency, arrival/departure taxes, and customs & quarantine regulations) change regularly. Your passport must have at least six months’ validity remaining when you arrive. Local immigration authorities may deny entry & deport people who do not meet this requirement, even if they intend on staying only for a short period. Important to consider:</p>
								<p>(1) Visas can take up to six weeks & a fee is normally charged. </p>
								<p>(2) Failure to obtain all necessary visas could cause you to miss part of your trip & will result in you incurring considerable expense & inconvenience.</p>
								<p>(3) It is better to apply for all visas through your travel agent before you leave home. Be aware that some visas can be purchased & arranged on arrival.</p>
								<p>(4) It is very important that the entry & exit dates are correct on the visa. Your travel agent will contact Questerra for full details. </p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  HOW MUCH LUGGAGE CAN I BRING?</h3>
								<p>There are some things to consider when packing for a Questerra India trip:</p>
								<p>• Due to the large number of coach rides on Questerra India trips, your luggage needs to meet the weight & restrictions imposed by Bus Operator. These limits are imposed by the provider, not by Questerra. Questerra is not responsible for any costs incurred by overweight luggage.</p>
								<p>• You are responsible for carrying your own luggage. At times this will be in hotels without elevators (as is common to the region), or onto various forms of transport, such as trains. On our trips, luggage is restricted to a maximum suitcase size of 73cm x 50cm x 25cm (29” x 20” x 10”) & maximum weight of 20 kg (44lbs) plus one small hand/day bag. Questerra reserves the right to refuse to accept larger & heavier suitcases on trip. Use of a backpack/rucksack is suggested, but not required. Wheeled suitcases can be used on Questerra trips in India. On overnight rail journeys, overnight Junk Boat, overnight guest stays & other journeys, as directed by your Trip Manager, you will be required to store your main luggage & utilize your smaller bag.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  NO COMPULSORY TIPPING - REWARD ONLY EXCELLENCE!</h3>
								<p>Every country in the world has different tipping policies & in India, within service industries, tipping is common practice. Tipping is totally optional & only given if you feel the service has exceeded your expectations. If you think your Questerra Team have done an exceptional job then you may wish to tip them. This is entirely discretionary – it’s completely up to you. No compulsory tipping – reward only excellence!</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  BOOKING SECURITY</h3>
								<p>Questerra has been running trips for young people & in all places we fully comply with local Travel Industry Laws.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  COMPULSORY INSURANCE</h3>
								<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on our trips, and we have some of the best deals on rates. We strongly recommend your insurance also covers cancellation, personal liability and loss of personal property. Please check that the insurance covers all of the activities that you are going to be participating in. Some policies exclude certain adventure activities. This should be arranged at the time of payment of the deposit and will, in certain circumstances, cover you against loss of deposit or cancellation fees from the date of confirmation of your booking, as shown in the insurance policy. Questerra cannot be held responsible for your failure to take out appropriate insurance and we recommend you purchase your insurance at or soon after booking your trip. You also agree to indemnify us against all third-party claims, actions, damages and remedies which may be brought against us in respect of your participation in the holiday.</p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">&bull;  MANAGE YOUR BOOKING</h3>

								<p>“Tell me what you eat, and I’ll tell you who you are” - Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin</p>
								<p>We are big on food! It has been an Endeavour to fill our tours with delectable local cuisine. India, a nation with varying cultures, languages, climates and people, boasts a span of history of thousands of years. Also, with a population of over a billion, 300 hundred languages along with 700 dialects, the various historical influences have significantly affected the cultural aspects of Indian culinary arts.</p>
								<p>From ‘Idiappam’ and ‘Puttu’; Idly, Dosai and a 100 varieties of rice from South India or the Maharashtrian ‘Bhaakhar vadi’, ‘Ussal Vadaa’ and ‘Pitla’ or the Bengali ‘Macher Jol’ or ‘Bangla Kichudi’;  Gujarati ‘Ponk’ or ‘Jowar Kichu’; Kashmiri ‘Kahwa’ or the Garhwali ‘Fanna’?  Kumouni ‘Mandua ki Roti’, the Konkani ‘Garadudde Paayas’, the Odiya ‘Jahni Posta’ or the Himachali ‘Channa Madra’;  India being a diverse country, even Indians might not know some of these recipes. Questerra makes sure to have maximum local fare in the meals promised on tour.</p>
								<p><u>Free Crash course on how to eat with your hands!</u></p>
								
								<h3 style="color:#ffc801;">(15) Zen Time</h3>
								<p>Journeys and travel we feel are incomplete without private time. Our hand crafted tours understand that and offer ample “ZEN” time for your relaxation, rejuvenation and retrospection; what’s more, they are usually in places which tend to Question your thought process.</p>
								<h3>Some examples of your ‘ZEN’ time include:</h3>
								<p>CAMPING the Hills</p>
								<p>Night TREKS</p>
								<p>Vineyard and Plantation WALKS</p>
								<p>Nature CAMPING</p>
								<p>Beach GAZING</p>
								<p>Temple STARING</p>
								<p>Pub CRAWLS </p>
